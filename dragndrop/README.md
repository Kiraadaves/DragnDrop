# About this Project

This project involved creating an image gallery with a drag and drop feature and a search feature as well. The app also has an authenticated login feature. You can log in with the following;
`Email: user@example.com Password: 1Password `

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) was used for the authentication while the images were generated using the free image API at [Pexels](https://pexels.com/) and the drag and drop was done with [react-beautiful-dnd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-beautiful-dnd)
